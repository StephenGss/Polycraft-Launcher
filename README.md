PolycraftLauncher
=========

PolycraftLauncher is a custom launcher for Minecraft that was built from MultiMC.  Per MultiMC's license, all references to MultiMC have been removed from the project. (except these first two sentences)


## Development
The project uses C++ and Qt5 as the language and base framework. This might seem odd in the Minecraft community, but allows using 25MB of RAM, where other tools use an excessive amount of resources for no reason.

We can do more, with less, on worse hardware and leave more resources for the game while keeping the launcher running and providing extra features.

### Building
If you want to build PolycraftLauncher yourself, check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

### Code formatting
We use [Clang Format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to format the project. We highly recommend setting it up so the project stays well formatted.
